## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to divide content and easily resize fonts with use of CSS rem units. The biggest challenge was to keep the QR frame in the middle of a screen while changing its size ;) I achived that using Flexbox properties.

```css
.container {
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```
### Continued development

I'm going to:
- learn more about HTML tags to use block and line elements more consciously,
- practice Flexbox properties

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.better.dev/centering-things-with-css-flexbox) - Centering the content with Flexbox very well explained.
- [Resource 2](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Nice explanation of Flexbox with very useful drawings.
